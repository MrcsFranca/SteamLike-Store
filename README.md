# 🕹️ SteamLike-Store
---
This crud was created for a college work.

In this project, you can add a new game, remove a game, search for it, and other options.
The main goal was to use dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and structures. I also tried to use files to write data and save the content.

## 👨‍💻 How to install and run

This project was made to run on the terminal

First, you will need to clone my GitHub repository

After that, just compile the C++ project: 

```bash
  g++ steamLike.cpp -o steamLike

And then run it:

```
